# Iris Dataset Analysis Project

This project explores the **Iris flower dataset**, preforming data cleaning, analysis, categorization, and visulaization using Python and Jypter Notebook.

# Dataset Decription

The Iris dataset is a classic dataset in machine learning and statistics. It includes **150 samples** of three different species of flowers:

- **Iris-setosa**
- **Iris-versicolor**
- **Iris-virginica**

Each sample has **five attributes**:

| Attribute      | Description                        |
|----------------|------------------------------------|
| Sepal Length   | Length of the sepal (cm)           |
| Sepal Width    | Width of the sepal (cm)            |
| Petal Length   | Length of the petal (cm)           |
| Petal Width    | Width of the petal (cm)            |
| Species        | Species of the flower (categorical)|

The dataset is available in `iris.data` and has been cleaned and summarized in this project.

## Steps Performed
### Phase 1 - initial jupytar notbook setup 
- Each group member wrote print("Hello, Iris!") statement
- Learned how to push and pull in Github
   
### Phase 2 – Variables, Control, Loops, Functions
- Defined dataset variables
- Used `if/else` statements to classify petal lengths
- Iterated through species using loops
- Created a function to classify flowers as **small**, **medium**, or **large**

### Phase 3 – Dataset Loading, Summary, and Cleaning
- Loaded the raw Iris dataset and assigned headers
- Created summary of raw dataset (row count, min, max, mean)
- Checked for missing values and duplicate rows
- Cleaned the dataset (remove empty/duplicate rows, fill missing numeric values)
- Created summary of cleaned dataset
- Saved cleaned dataset as `iris_cleaned.csv`
